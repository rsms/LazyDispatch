# Lazy dispatcher

A very thin API + concepts on top of libdispatch (aka Grand Central Dispatch) for Cocoa Objective-C code.

I'm a lazy person and so it hurts me when I have to write so much to do such common things as to schedule various blocks of code in various dispatch queues. This little thing lets me write less code with the added bonus of making the result more readable.

### Example

First, using vanilla libdispatch:

```objc
dispatch_queue_t parentQueue = dispatch_get_current_queue();
dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{
  NSLog(@"Block #1 on queue '%s' (parentQueue: '%s')",
        dispatch_queue_get_label(dispatch_get_current_queue()),
        dispatch_queue_get_label(parentQueue));
  
  dispatch_queue_t parentQueue2 = dispatch_get_current_queue();
  dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
    NSLog(@"Block #2 on queue '%s'",
          dispatch_queue_get_label(dispatch_get_current_queue()));
    
    dispatch_async(parentQueue2, ^{
      NSLog(@"Block #3 on queue '%s'",
            dispatch_queue_get_label(dispatch_get_current_queue()));
      exit(0);
    });
  });
});
```

Now, with LazyDispatch:

```objc
sched_background ^(DQueue parentQueue){
  NSLog(@"Block #1 on queue '%s' (parentQueue: '%s')",
        DQueueID(__queue), DQueueID(parentQueue));

  sched_main ^(DQueue parentQueue){
    NSLog(@"Block #2 on queue '%s'", DQueueID(__queue));

    sched(parentQueue) ^{
      NSLog(@"Block #3 on queue '%s'", DQueueID(__queue));
    };
  };
};
```

See. Way simpler yet same performance as no actual overhead is added. We just rephrased things to be a little more readable.

Output:

    Block #1 on queue 'com.apple.root.default-priority' (parentQueue: 'com.apple.main-thread')
    Block #2 on queue 'com.apple.main-thread'
    Block #3 on queue 'com.apple.root.default-priority'

Wow! I can haz so much fun nows!

## API

### Types

- `DQueue` — alias for `dispatch_queue_t`
- `DBlock` — alias for `dispatch_block_t`

### Special variables

- `__queue` → `DQueue` — The current queue
- `__main_queue` → `DQueue` — The main queue

### Keyword expressions

#### sched_background block([DQueue parentQueue]) → block

Schedules `block` in the background queue. The block can optionally accept an
argument which will be the queue from which `sched_background` was called.
The result of the expression is the block itself.

Useful for invoking callbacks and returning control to the same queue, e.g:

```objc
- (void)doSomethingFunkyWithCallback:(DBlock)callback {
  sched_background ^(DQueue parentQueue){
    // work work work ...
    sched(parentQueue) callback;
  };
}
```

#### sched_main block([DQueue parentQueue]) → block

Schedules `block` in the main queue. The block can optionally accept an argument
which will be the queue from which `sched_main` was called. The result of the
expression is the block itself.

#### sched(DQueue queue) block([DQueue parentQueue]) → block

Schedules `block` in a `queue`. The block can optionally accept an argument
which will be the queue from which `sched` was called. The result of the
expression is the block itself.

### Functions

#### const char* DQueueID(DQueue queue)

Access the human-readable identifier of `queue` (its "label")
